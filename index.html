      <h2>About Me üëß</h2>
      <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Mira, nice to meet you. I‚Äôm currently a graduate student in Digital Humanities at the University of Alberta, Canada. I see myself as a lifelong learner and passionate creator. I love writing, reading, and bringing diverse creative ideas to life.</p>

      <p>As a scholar in digital humanities, I am committed to integrating traditional humanities with digital technologies, uncovering fresh possibilities in literary analysis, data visualization, and storytelling. My current research interests include gender studies, game design, and digital narratives.</p>

      <p>Outside academia, I find joy in expressing creativity through various media. Writing articles, planning projects, and turning imaginative concepts into tangible outcomes fuel my enthusiasm. This continuous creative journey helps me grow both personally and professionally.</p>

      <h2>Design Concept üí°</h2>
      <p>In my creative universe, the themes of ‚Äúroad,‚Äù ‚Äúchoice,‚Äù and ‚Äúdirection‚Äù are central. I firmly believe digital media‚Äîwhether interactive games or narrative texts‚Äîserve as carriers of thoughts and emotions, externalizing the creator‚Äôs internal world. Each piece I create is, at its core, an exchange of ideas.</p>

      <p>I deeply value feedback from my audience, viewing it as a vital resource for growth. These insights help me continuously refine my approach, aligning my work more closely with the emotions and ideas I hope to convey and enabling deeper connections with my audience. For me, games are more than just entertainment; they are integral parts of our cultural landscape, shaping communities and communicating values.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, I hope those engaging with my work feel connected to the embedded ideas, finding moments of spiritual comfort or resonance. This aspiration is rooted in my own experiences. I understand the importance of warmth and encouragement and aim to infuse these elements into every project I create.</p>

      <h2>Designer Experience üö∂</h2>
      <p>For a long time, I lived within predefined frameworks, passively accepting external judgments and societal expectations, and following paths laid out for me. Literature was my safe haven, a world in which I could immerse myself deeply in ideas and conversations through words. However, I gradually recognized that relying solely on writing limited my ability to fully express my creative visions. I craved more diverse forms of creative expression and the opportunity to transform my ideas into tangible creations.</p>

      <p>Discovering programming languages opened a new door for me. Before joining the University of Alberta, I had almost no exposure to code languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, or SQL. Yet, my journey into digital humanities quickly revealed the unique allure of digital creation. Through even simple code, abstract concepts become three-dimensional, interactive experiences. This power to concretely represent ideas lies at the heart of digital creation.</p>

      <p>I believe digital media is a new way to share my perspectives and produce unique, meaningful work. Not every creation must aim for grandeur; sometimes, simply creating something meaningful and leaving your mark is a profoundly valuable form of existence.</p>
